# QA Manual Testing Portfolio

## Project Overview
This repository contains a manual testing case study performed on a public web-based demo e-commerce application. The purpose of this project is to demonstrate structured QA thinking, manual test design, exploratory testing, and professional bug reporting.

The project focuses on functional and usability testing of core user flows. Automation, performance testing, and security testing are intentionally out of scope.

## Test Scope
**In scope:**
- User registration and login
- Product browsing
- Add to cart functionality
- Form validation
- Navigation and UI behavior

**Out of scope:**
- Payment processing
- Performance testing
- Security testing
- Mobile application testing

## Testing Approach
- Black-box testing
- Risk-based testing
- Manual functional testing
- Exploratory testing
- Negative and boundary testing

## Test Environment
- Browser: Google Chrome (latest)
- OS: Windows 10
- Test data: Dummy user accounts and sample products

## Artifacts Included
- Test Plan
- Manual Test Cases
- Exploratory Testing Session
- Bug Reports
- Test Summary Report

## Key Findings
- Validation and UI consistency issues identified
- One high-severity defect affecting cart persistence
- Multiple usability issues impacting user experience

## Limitations
Testing is limited to visible UI behavior of a public demo application and does not represent production constraints.
